Every American belly dancer, as well as dancers throughout the world, are practicing the legacy started by one relentlessly dedicated woman: Jamila Salimpour.

## This Code

Here's some silly code I strung together to help my dance drilling and practice. It randomly puts Jamila Salimpour Dance Format steps together into a combo that can be drilled in repeat.

If you want to know what these steps mean, please check out the Salimpour School of dance. To find out more information and to find local certified teachers near you: [http://www.salimpourschool.com](http://www.salimpourschool.com).
